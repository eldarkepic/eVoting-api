CS308 PROJECT - Electronic Voting System following Agile software development process

Voting is a fundamental instrument of democracy that provides people with an official way to express their opinion. Traditionally, the voting process is quite tedious because people must come in person to vote. 
This fact results in a low turnout percentage.

The application will be simply designed in order to vote quickly and without any difficulties. The main goal of this application is to prevent manipulation and frauds of votes. To achieve that goal, voters will enter their ID’s which will be checked in the main database. 
If there are any irregularities voter will not be able to access vote list. Counting of votes will be automated and transparent to everyone.

The overall system objective is to provide an efficient design that will reduce the system’s complexity, facilitate change and result in an easy implementation.
